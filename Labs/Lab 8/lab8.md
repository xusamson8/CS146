### Lab 8
think about what was went over in class, we should go with a greedy approach, but it won't work all the time. Think of if the 5 cent denomination is removed
sub problem may be that the amount changes when we subtract a denomination once?
- meanin we will probbaly need something with dynamic programming as well such as memoization

based off test cases... 
if the amount is 0, return 0, if not possible return -1.. this will be true all the time
