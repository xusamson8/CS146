#### Java
base case to check if the root is null, if it is then we have nothing to invert and return null
recursively call the invertTree function for the left and right subtrees. This then swaps the nodes, after everything is swapped, we eventually go back up and swap the subtrees themselves. 

#### Python
same implementation as java but in python syntax
