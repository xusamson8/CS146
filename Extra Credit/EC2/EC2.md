#### Can we use heaps as priority queues? How so? Write an explanation, with the help of pseudocode/diagrams to support your explanation.
We CAN use heaps as priority queues, such as max or min heaps. I will use the max heap as an example, by definition, max heap is a binary tree where the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum-value element at the root. 

```

#### Given a max heap, is there a way to use the max heap as a min heap, without writing a whole min heap implementation? Is the opposite also true? Justify your answer with pseudocode, and/or python OR java code, and explain your answer.
