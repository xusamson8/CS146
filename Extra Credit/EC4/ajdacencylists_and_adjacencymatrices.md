### "Everything Everywhere All At Once"
implementations (in both java and python) and explanations are all presented under each question in this markdown file.

#### Given an adjacency list, how can you convert it to an adjacency matrix? 
- since an adjacency list contains a list for each vertex, and inside the list are lists that contain the neighbors of the vertex. With this knowledge, we can now ocnvert it to a matrix, to do this, we can create a 'n * n' matrix , where n is the number of vertices (for the example we saw in class there were 5 vertices and it was a 5 by 5). We can iterate over each list and set matrix[n][v] to "True" to each neighbor "n" of vertex "v"
(for the purposes of this class we would set the vertex referring to itself to False).
