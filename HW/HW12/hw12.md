### HW 12
Intuition: Kruskal's Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree: we care about the minimum to supply water to the houses from pipes or connecting it ot the wells. We need to find the minimum spanning tree of pipes, giving us the cheapest cost to connect water to the houses, we also need to keep track of the nodes, which helps us track which well is the cheapest, to start the water connection. 

for the given test case:
Input: n = 2, wells = [1,1], pipes = [[1,2,1],[1,2,2]]
Output: 2
there are two nodes, both nodes have 1 cost for the wells, node 1 and node 2 are connected by pipe with 1 cost, and node 1 and node 2 are connected with a pipe that has two cost, we need to find the cheapest way

#### Java
we want to find the minimum spanning tree.
since the wells have a cost as well, we have to make virtual nodes, connecting the cost of wells to the houses
for kruskals we should sort the cost of the edges
now that its in order, we may loop through all the edges, connecting the houses
once connected, we can decrement the number of houses, at this time we also add he costs to a variable.
if we have no more houses to iterate over, we can return our answer with the final answer of added pipes and wells.

#### Python
same intuition but in python
