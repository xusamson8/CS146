### HW 10
intuition: each we go to level makes a new list, its is easiest to keep updating and adding onto an arraylist, we will return an arraylist of arraylists,
at each level there will be a new lists added to the arraylist
we want to run and implement BFS (going level to level, left to right) 

a queue is used to implement BFS, elements inserted to the right and popped from the left (FIFO)

we take first element(s) and add to queue --> remove and add to the sublist (that way we know the entire level is gone through, when the queue is empty and sublist is complete), but when its popped, we need to add its children (add children to queue left to right) , now we go through the next level, have the elemtns added to the queue from left to righ and then pop in the same order and then add to sublist, check if there are any children and if there are then add to queue.
when the we reacht he leaf nodes and find out they have no children we know we're done, we can also tell that we ar done since the queue is empty and nothing is added to it anymore.
now we'll have a sublist for every level, and we'll have to package it into one list and return the final list. 

#### Java
create a queue and a final answer arraylist that we will return
have the root element as the first element in tht quqeu (FIFO)
create a while loop that runs when the queue isnt empty
    create an integer that represents the size of the queue
    create an arraylost that represents the level in the queue
    createa a for loop that runs through th size of the queue
        if the node's let and right child values are not empty, offer/ add them to the queue. 
        add the value we're currently on to the 'level' array list
    add the levels into the result /answer array list
    return the answer arraylist.



#### Python
similar implementation as the java solution, but with python syntax
