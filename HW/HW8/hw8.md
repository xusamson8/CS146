### HW8
we need to figure out the length of the longest palindrome possible given the string.

I can notice that there is a property, we see that each character in the output has a duo (even # of occurences), except 1 letter. 

intuition: we would count the letters in a string, that has one duplicate, with that count we can multiply it by 2 and add 1 , since 1 non-duplicate is acceptable. A set would help us count the letters that have a duplicate.
