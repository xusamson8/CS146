### HW 11
intuition: we want to change the color of a given pixel, given the newColor, and the starting point is the color that we would want to change.
To do this, we would have to go 4-directionally and find which colors match the one we want to change (rules of flood-fill)

We can do this recursively, using DFS intuition, recursively call a helper function that changes the color, do this in each direction.


#### Java

Our helper function, helps fill out the pixel (changes its color), and has a recursive 4-directional call.
Firstly our base cases, we check if we are going out of bounds, or if the pixel we're on does NOT match the color we want to change, if this is true , then return and the recursion stops for that direction. 
otherwise, if the color matches the one we want to change (say we are one 1 and we want to change 1's that are 4-directionally connected to 2's), then we may change its color

recursive:
call out helper functions, in 4 directions (we can do this by calling it 4 times, each time with the rows or columns changed from the start, we can +1 or -1 to the rows and columns to have this effect)

main method: 
if the starting point already is the newColor, then we dont have to do anything!
otherwise, call the helper function
after everything runs, we can return the final image.

#### Python
same implementation as the java version, but with pythopn syntax.
